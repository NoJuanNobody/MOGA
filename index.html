			<h3 class="light">Fitness</h3>
			<p class="lead">Yoga is now common in mainstream <a href="http://www.mensfitness.com/life/sports/yoga-for-athletes">sports</a>.  The meaning of fitness is expanded in yoga to integrate mind and body through the action of breath and conscious movement.  Fitness is also developed in a non-competitive atmosphere, which allows increased focus on self, leading to higher levels of overall fitness.  An improved fitness gained in yoga can then be applied productively in competitive sports.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h3 class="light">Energy</h3>
			<p class="lead">Yoga is restorative to the mind and to the body (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3193654/).  The therapeutic effects of yoga can be felt as renewed energy.  The practice acts as a slow and progressive cure from physical and emotional ailments that when unchecked drain us of our vitality.  Yoga also develops our energy through focused practice.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h3 class="light">Performance</h3>
			<p class="lead">Our success depends on our performance in all spheres of life.  Yoga develops a state of calm abiding that can be described as a confident state of being "in the zone"; aware yet calm, ready yet contained.  Performance benefits of yoga are well documented (http://www.ijpp.com/IJPP%20archives/2001_45_3/351-354.pdf).  Increased energy and fitness only partly describe the performance benefits from yoga in all aspects of life, social, home, work and sports.
